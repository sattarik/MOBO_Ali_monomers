AutoOED supports exporting all kinds of data related to the optimization, 
including the database data, optimization statistics and figures.


Database
--------

You can export the whole database as a CSV file by clicking ``Export->Database`` from the menu.
It will launch a system window asking you where should the CSV file be and the name of the file.

   :width: 700 px

   :width: 300 px

You can select which statistics to export then click the ``Export`` button. Similarly, a system window will pop up
asking about the file location and file name. After that, the CSV file will be generated at the specified location.
